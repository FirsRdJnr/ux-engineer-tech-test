The game has 3 Freespin bonuses, the top bonus being a  1000 Win Spins with Colossal Wilds. On activation of one of the  bonuses, there is a unique gamble feature.</p>\r\n<p>Each press of SPIN will action each reel to spin to a random  position. Wins are paid for matching 2, 3, 4 or 5 of-a-kind symbols from  left to right on any payline.<br /><br /><strong>Set Your Stake</strong><br />The  player can choose their stake by pressing the plus and minus buttons on  the right of the screen. The stake will be shown in the stake meter.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There are WILD magic orb symbols which substitute for all symbols. The Wild symbols can substitute for the other symbols to help create a line win, except scatters (feature trigger vial symbols).</li>\r\n<li>At the top of reels are 3 shelves containing 5 areas to collect vials to unlock the related &lsquo;Free Spin&rsquo; bonuses.</li>\r\n<li>The Free Spin bonuses are as follows:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Pink Vial Bonus</strong><br />500 Free Spins with Stacked Wilds. Extra Wild symbols stacked in threes are added to the reels, which spin through the reel apertures to a random stop.<br /><br /><strong>Blue Vial Bonus</strong><br /> 750 Free Spins with Expanding Wilds. Any Wild symbols that land in view on reels 1 to 5 will expand to fill the whole reel aperture.<br /><br /><strong>Gold Vial Bonus</strong><br />1000 Free Spins with Colossal Wilds. Extra Colossal Wild symbols, that can span more than 1 reel, are added to the reels. These spin through the reel apertures to a random stop.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>During the main game play there will be, at random, Pink, Blue and Gold vial symbols landing in the reel frames. These vials are scatters and trigger anywhere within the reel window on reels 1 and 2.</li>\r\n<li>Only 2 of-a-kind matching vial symbols, landing sequentially and paying left to right, will trigger the gamble event.</li>\r\n<li>The activated Free Spins feature will enter centre of the screen, showing the player how many vials they have collected and how many there are to go. Reels 3, 4 and 5 keep spinning in anticipation of more vials landing on the reels.</li>\r\n<li>The game will present to the player a Free Spin offer to buy the vials off the player by prompting them to 'Collect'.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>The player can choose either to take the amount of Free Spins offered and 'Collect' or 'Gamble' some or all of the Free Spins offered to see if further vials of the same colour land on reels 3, 4 and 5.</li>\r\n<li>If the player has gambled some or all of the offered Free Spins and no further vial lands on the next reel, then the gamble event is over and any collected Free Spins then play out on the reels.</li>\r\n<li>If a further vial lands on the next reel, the gamble event will happen again. This will be the same on each of the reels, so the player is prompted to 'Collect' or 'Gamble' on each of the outcomes for reel 3 and 4 if the same vials land in these reels.</li>\r\n<li>The player may part-collect some of their Free Spins at each gamble point. The collected Free Spins will be played out once reel 5 has a resolution.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pressing the rotating arrow icon above the Spin button will open a dialogue panel from which the player can access the auto plays adjuster.</li>\r\n<li>Pressing the &lsquo;i&rsquo; icon, on the right-hand side, will open the Paytable information. The player can tap the arrows left and right to access all the game information. Pressing the &lsquo;X&rsquo; button will return the player to the main game interface.</li>\r\n<li>Accessing the Paytable will allow the player to toggle the sounds on/off. On a device that is compatible, the player can also turn on/off the vibrate function. On launch of the game, the default setting will be ON for both of these options.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Paytable</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Only the highest win per bet line is paid.</li>\r\n<li>Line wins will pay from leftmost reel to rightmost reel.</li>\r\n<li>Adjustment of the stake will dynamically alter the awards in the paytable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Game Recovery</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In the event of a game in real play being interrupted, (i.e. started but not completed due to connectivity issues or accidentally closing the browser, etc.), depending on the previous state of the game, it will either resume from the point of the last spin or display the outcome of the game already in play.</li>\r\n<li>Any winnings will be correctly credited to the player account and will be exact according to the result prior to the game being interrupted.</li>\r\n</ul><p><strong>General Information</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This game has a theoretical Return to Player (RTP) of between 88.19% and 94.02%.</li>\r\n<li>The maximum payout in one spin in this game is &pound;500,000 / &euro;500,000.</li>\r\n<li><strong>System malfunction voids all pays and all plays.</strong></li>\r\n<li>Due to high production values of this game, lower-tier hardware may run into compatibility issues and, in certain instances, you will not be able to play. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&copy; Copyright 2016 CORE Gaming Limited &ndash; All rights reserved.</li>\r\n<li>Unauthorised copying of any images or content by any means is not permitted</li>\r\n</ul>",

The snake segments are chained together but can cover any of the 6x4 reel positions. The snake will then leave the reels back to its basket leaving a pattern of Wilds.<p>These modifiers don&rsquo;t guarantee a win, but any wins will be paid to the player.</p>\r\n<h3>Free Spins</h3>\r\n<p>During Free Spins, there can be bonus trigger symbols which will re-trigger the Free Spins feature.

On the next Free Spin the Grass Snake will be replaced by the Mamba, this time dropping 5 Wilds, again any wins will be processed. On the next spin the Mamba that has left will be replaced by the Rattle (6 Wilds). This will continue upgrading the snake for all 7 Free Spins, ending with the final spin with the Anaconda snake of 10 Wild positions.</p><p><strong>Snake Adder</strong>: The first snake Grass arrives on the first Free Spin dropping 4 Wilds, this then swiftly slithers off before the reels stop.

Before the next spin the snake will slither off leaving a &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; pattern.</p><p><strong>Snake Bite</strong>: Random Wilds distributed in pairs co-joined in parallel. The Cobra snake will randomly bite symbols in pairs and turn them into Wilds. With each bite there will be 2 horizontal Wilds added to the reels.

This game has 7% RTP allocated to the CJB.</p><p>Each press of PLAY will action each reel to spin to a random position. Wins are paid for matching some 2 of-a-kind and all 3, 4 or 5 of-a-kind symbols.</p>\r\n<p>All wins are paid left to right. All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left.</p>\r\n<p>All wins shown on different win lines will be shown and paid to the player.</p>\r\n<p>The Wild symbol can substitute for ALL other symbols EXCEPT scatter symbols to help create a line win. Using a wild symbol to complete a line does not incur any extra multiplier other than the win for the symbol(s) it substitutes. Only the highest paying win on each line will be counted.</p>\r\n<p>During the base game modifiers and the free spins event, the 5 reels can expand to 7 reels in total.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Set Your Stake</strong></p>\r\n<p>The player can choose their stake by pressing the &ldquo;+&rdquo; and &ldquo;-&rdquo; buttons on the left of the screen. The stake will be shown in the Total Stake meter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\r\n<p>During the game, the reels may change and modify a spin with one of three base game modifiers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wild Reel modifier:</strong> During the main game, on random occasions, a modifier can activate a mechanical effect to reveal an extra reel to the left of the conventional 5 reels. The player will now be presented with 6 reels. This new first reel will contain stacked wilds which will give the player a much greater chance of creating a win, as wins will be paid for 3 of a kind on 2 symbols on the 2nd&nbsp;and 3rd reels on a winline because of the new wilds. Also, the reel will be populated with the 2 top paying symbols.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Multiplier Reel modifier:</strong>&nbsp;During the main game, the reels may shudder and activate a mechanical effect to reveal a further reel to the right of the conventional 5 reels. The player will now be presented with 6 reels. This new last reel will contain various multipliers. This extra reel &nbsp;can significantly alter the values of the wins compared to the normal base game spins. This new last reel will be distributed with multipliers which will also spin through the reel apertures. If a win is created via a connecting winline, then where the winline ends on this reel will award that multiplier and times that value too.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wild and Multiplier Reels modifier:</strong> During the main game, on random occasions, the reels will shudder and activate a mechanical effect revealing a further 2 reels left and right of the conventional 5 reels. The player now will be presented with 7 reels (as per freespins). The first reel will contain stacked wilds with top symbols and the last and 7th&nbsp;reel will contain multipliers. Both of these extra reels significantly alter the frequency and the values of the wins compared to the normal base game spins.</p>\r\n<p>If 3 bonus scatter symbols land on reels 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, then this triggers the Free Spins feature.</p>\r\n<p>If 4 or 5 bonus trigger symbols land, then the more free spins are given for each extra symbol.</p>\r\n<p>3 Scatter symbols = 5 initial Freespins</p>\r\n<p>4 Scatter symbols = 10 initial Freespins</p>\r\n<p>5 Scatter symbols = 25 initial Freespins</p>\r\n<p>Once the feature has been triggered the reels will expand left and right to reveal 2 further reels either end of the conventional 5 reels. The furthest left reel (now reel 1) will contain stacked wilds 3 high which will spin through the reel aperture. This reel will also be populated with the 2 highest paying symbols. The furthest right reel (now reel 7) will contain a series of multipliers. Any connecting win going through the win line will connect to one of the 3 multipliers shown in the last reel aperture.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Free Spins feature:</strong>&nbsp;The player now will be presented with 7 reels. The first reel will contain stacked wilds/high paying symbols and the last and 7th&nbsp;reel will contain multipliers. Both of these extra reels significantly alter the frequency and the values of the wins compared to the normal base game spins.</p>\r\n<p>The player will get an initial amount of Free Spins from bonus symbols, however during the &lsquo;Free Spins&rsquo; the scatter bonus symbols will still be present on the reels.

The game utilises these top set of 3 reels which mirror the reel positions on the base game in order to implement 3 base game reel modifiers and a Free Spins bonus game.</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%;\">This game is portrait in orientation only.</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background: white;\">Set your stake: On the bottom of the screen, the player can choose their stake by pressing the + and - buttons. The stake will be shown in the Total Stake meter.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background: white;\">Each press of PLAY will action each bottom reel to spin to a random position. Wins are paid for matching 3, 4 or 5 of-a-kind symbols </span>on winlines.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background: white;\">Line wins pay left to right. All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning from the leftmost reel.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background: white;\">All wins shown on different winlines will be shown and paid to the player.</span></p>\r\n<p>Wild symbols(W, BW): The Wild&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;(W)&nbsp;can substitute for ALL other symbols&nbsp;EXCEPT the scatter symbols (S). However,&nbsp;&lsquo;Bonus Wild&rsquo; symbols&nbsp;(BW)&nbsp;can substitute for&nbsp;ALL other symbols, including&nbsp;scatter bonus symbols except the &lsquo;Eye of the Horus&rsquo; symbol.</p>\r\n<p>Using Wild symbols&nbsp;(W, BW)&nbsp;to complete a line does not incur any extra multiplier, unless stated as a multiplier, other than the win for the symbol(s) they substitute. Only the highest paying win on each line will be counted.</p>\r\n<p>Bonus Scatter Symbols (S): These symbols can appear on reels 1,2, 3, 4 &amp; 5. Two scatter symbols on the reels will trigger an anticipation on the next reel. Three or more scatter symbols will trigger the bonus Free Spins feature.</p>\r\n<p>To award the bonus feature, the player needs at least 3 Bonus trigger symbols and/or &lsquo;Bonus Wild&rsquo; symbols.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>3 x Bonus symbol = 10 Free Spins + 1x stake win.</li>\r\n<li>4 x Bonus symbol =10 Free Spins + 10x stake win.</li>\r\n<li>5 x Bonus symbol = 10 Free Spins + 50x stake win.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Game Features</strong></p>\r\n<p>During the base game, game if a player lands a &lsquo;spin&rsquo; (Eye of Horus) symbol on reel 5 they will receive a spin on the lowest bonus wheel before any wins get paid. This wheel will contain &lsquo;Wild Reel&rsquo; symbols (WR) and/or Blanks.</p>\r\n<p>If a &lsquo;Wild Reel&rsquo; symbol (WR) appears it will convert the reel directly below to a Wild reel and then pay any subsequent wins.</p>\r\n<p>The 2 higher bonus wheels are only in play during the random modifiers and the Free S</p>\r\n<p>If a top reel Wild drops and lands on top of a Bonus Scatter Symbol, the position will become a Bonus Wild symbol (BW), which substitutes for all other symbols.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Base Game Modifiers</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%;\">During the base game, on EVERY spin, there will be a chance that the &lsquo;Eye of Horus&rsquo; atop of the bonus reels will glow and show a &lsquo;Pick Me&rsquo; from 3 coins to award one of the following modifiers, (these do not guarantee a win):</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><strong>Wild Treasure</strong>:</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%;\">The 3 bonus wheels start spinning and contain only Wilds or blanks on the reels. Once the 3 bonus wheels stop, the player will see a pattern of Wilds on the 3 bonus wheels. Wherever the pattern of Wilds appear on the bonus wheels, would then effectively appear on the base game as Wild overlays before the base game reels then conclude awarding any wins using the random Wild patterns now in play.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reel Treasure:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The 3 bonus wheels start spinning and contain only cash values or blanks on the reels. Once the 3 bonus wheels stop, the player will see a pattern of cash on the 3 bonus wheels. These values will then be added up and contribute to the total win. This does guarantee an instant win and is not exclusive of any natural spinning win.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Queen&rsquo;s Treasure</strong>:</p>\r\n<p>This is the rarest modifier. The 3 bonus wheels start spinning, however the very top wheel will turn into a &lsquo;Mega Multiplier&rsquo; wheel. This wheel will contain a variety of values distributed on all the symbol positions. The range will be between x2 and x100 multipliers. The other bottom two wheels will contain only Wilds, blanks and on wheel 2 (middle wheel) a &lsquo;Mega Multiplier&rsquo; symbol.</p>\r\n<p>Once the 3 bonus wheels stop, the player will see a pattern of Wilds on the 2 bonus wheels. Wherever the pattern of Wilds appear on the bonus wheels, any that are directly above a base game reel will turn that corresponding reel &lsquo;Wild&rsquo;. Should the random wheels stop so that there are 2 &lsquo;Wilds&rsquo; stacked above a reel, then this will turn that corresponding reel &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; but also x2. Any connecting win through this x2 Wild reel will double the win. Landing the &lsquo;Mega Multiplier&rsquo; symbol will spin the very top bonus wheel. There will be a clear win aperture centre of the top wheel.</p>\r\n<p>Once this &lsquo;Mega Multiplier&rsquo; wheel comes to a halt the multiplier that is directly centre on the wheel in the win aperture will multiply any total win on the base game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Free Spins</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the Free Spin bonus round, the player will start with a fixed number of 10 Free Spins and these will play out individually like normal spins. Bonus symbols are not present during Free Spins. Additional Free Spins can be gained via the middle bonus reel.</p>\r\n<p>If the player lands a &lsquo;spin&rsquo; (Eye of Horus) symbol anywhere in the aperture on reel 5 during Free Spins, the bottom 2 bonus wheels will spin together, increasing the prize potential.</p>\r\n<p>The bottom bonus wheel will remain as it is in base game with either &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; reels or blanks.</p>\r\n<p>The middle bonus wheel will include Wilds, blanks and a &lsquo;Mega Multiplier&rsquo; symbol. Should the random wheels stop so that there are 2 &lsquo;Wilds&rsquo; stacked above a reel, then this will turn that corresponding reel &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; but also x2. Any connecting win through this x2 Wild reel will double that win. Any other stacked &lsquo;Wilds&rsquo; on the bonus wheels will also turn into Wild reels X2.</p>\r\n<p>Populated on Bonus wheel 2 (middle wheel) are &lsquo;Mega Multiplier&rsquo; and extra Free Spins segments.</p>\r\n<p>Landing the &lsquo;Mega Multiplier&rsquo; symbol will spin the very top bonus wheel, the top wheel contains high multipliers between X2 and X100. There will be a clear win aperture centre of the top wheel. Once this &lsquo;Mega Multiplier&rsquo; wheel comes to a halt the multiplier that is directly centre on the wheel in the win aperture will multiply any total win on the base game.</p>\r\n<p>All Free Spins wins will be relative to current total bet and the base game P</p>\r\n<p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; background: white;\">Pressing the rotating arrow icon, next to the PLAY button, will open the Autoplay functionality. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background: white;\">Pressing the &lsquo;settings&rsquo; button, on the right-side of the PLAY button, will open the Paytable information.

The slot also features &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wild&rsquo; base game modifiers.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Set your stake: At the left of the screen, the player can choose their stake by pressing the + and - buttons. The chosen stake will be shown in the Total Stake meter.</li>\r\n<li>Each press of PLAY will action each reel to spin to a random position. Wins are paid for matching 3, 4, 5 or 6 of-a-kind symbols on .</li>\r\n<li>Line wins pay left to right. All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning from the leftmost reel.</li>\r\n<li>All wins shown on different winlines will be shown and paid to the player.</li>\r\n<li>Wild symbols: The Wild&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;can substitute for ALL other symbols&nbsp;EXCEPT the scatter symbols. Using Wild symbols to complete a line does not incur any extra multiplier, unless stated as a multiplier, other than the win for the symbol(s) they substitute. Only the highest paying win on each line will be counted.</li>\r\n<li>Bonus Scatter Symbols: symbols can appear on any reel. Three or more bonus symbolsin view will trigger the bonus Free Spins feature. </li>\r\n<li>3 Bonus symbols award - 7 Free Spins.</li>\r\n<li>4 Bonus symbols award - 7 Free Spins + 5x stake win.</li>\r\n<li>5 Bonus symbols award - 7 Free Spins + 20x stake win.</li>\r\n<li>6 Bonus symbols award - 7 Free Spins + 50x stake win.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Base Game Modifiers</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>During the base game, on EVERY spin at random, the base reels may spin longer than usual and Elle will drink some fuel and blow flames onto the reels. There will be, at random, between 4 and 10 Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; blown onto the reels.</li>\r\n<li>These modifiers don&rsquo;t guarantee a win, but any wins will be paid to the player.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Free Spins</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>During Free Spins, there can be bonus scatter symbols land which will trigger extra Free Spins. The amount of extra Free Spins will depend on the amount of bonus trigger symbols in view on that spin (see values below):                    \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 scatters = 3 extra Free Spins</li>\r\n<li>3 scatters = 5 extra Free Spins</li>\r\n<li>4 scatters = 7 extra Free Spins</li>\r\n<li>5 scatters = 10 extra Free Spins</li>\r\n<li>6 scatters = 15 extra Free Spins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Flamin&rsquo; Riches</strong>: Elle will take a swig of fuel and blow only one flame out covering the reels.&nbsp;On each and every Free Spin, Elle will drink more fuel/breath in more/blow a longer flame per spin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>On the first Free Spin, Elle will drink fuel, take a deep breath and blow a flame on to the reels. Once the fire dissipates, it will reveal 4 &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; in random positions whilst the reels are spinning. When the reels come to a halt, any resulting wins will be processed. On the next spin, Elle will drink more fuel, breathed deeper and blow a longer flame this time, revealing 5 &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo;. This scenario will continue upgrading the amount of &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; for all 7 Free Spins, ending with the final spin. On this final spin, Elle will pull out a flame thrower and burn the reels with a massive flame, revealing 10 &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wild&rsquo; positions. Any final wins will be processed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Blaze it Up</strong>: The same game mechanic will apply. Elle will take a swig of fuel and blow one flame out covering the reels. On each and every Free Spin, Elle will drink fuel, breath in and blow a flame per spin.                    \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>On the first Free Spin, Elle will drink fuel, breath and blow a flame on to the reels. Once the fire dissipates, it will reveal 4 &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; on the screen whilst the reels are spinning. When the reels come to a halt, any wins will be processed.&nbsp; If there is NO win, then, on that spin, Elle will drink more fuel, breathe deeper and blow a longer flame, this time revealing 5 &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo;. &nbsp;This scenario will continue upgrading the amount of &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; for all 7 Free Spins if there has been NO win, ending with the final spin. If at any point the &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; create a win on that spin, then on the next flame blow, the same amount of &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; will be present and there will be NO upgrade.</li>\r\n<li>As soon as the player gets NO win, the current &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; will be upgraded to the next &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wild&rsquo; level for the subsequent Free Spin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Hot or Not</strong>: Random chance of any &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wild&rsquo; scenario. On each and every Free Spin, there is a random chance Elle will drink fuel, breath in and either blow flames and award &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; or not drink any fuel and therefore award no Flamin&rsquo; Wilds.&nbsp;                    \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>On a chance basis, the next spin may have NO &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; via Elle, or award between 4 and 10 Flamin&rsquo; Wilds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Heat is On</strong>: Random Wilds distributed in pairs co-joined in parallel. On each and every Free Spin, Elle will drink fuel, breath in and blow flames to award &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; onto the reels. The Wilds may be populated via Elle performing several flame blows and there may be 2 to 6 &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; and any combination awarded during any flame blow. There will always be between 2 and 6 &lsquo;Flamin&rsquo; Wilds&rsquo; awarded for each Free Spin, therefore Elle will burn (2-6 symbols) Wilds on each spin. This process continues until all 7 Free Spins have been exhausted.</li>\r\n<li>All Free Spins wins will be relative to current total bet and the base game paytable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>Buttons</h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pressing the rotating arrow icon, next to the PLAY button, will open the Autoplay functionality.</li>\r\n<li>Pressing the &lsquo;settings&rsquo; button, on the right-hand side of the base game screen, will open the paytable information. The player can press the left and right arrow buttons to access the in-game information.

Between 1 and 4 reels in any of the 5 reel apertures can turn Wild. Any winnings once reels come to a halt are paid to the player. The Frog will activate 1 to 5 of Wild reels before the finishing positions have settled.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\"><strong><span class=\"c33 c36\">Random Wilds</span>&nbsp;(<span class=\"c31\">Cotton Shakin&rsquo; Wilds):</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span class=\"c7\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\">Random Wilds appear on the reels before symbols land and award any winnings once reels come to a halt. The frog will awake, activating a number of random Wild positions before finishing positions have settled.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\"><strong><span class=\"c33 c36\">Mega Symbol</span><span class=\"c33\">&nbsp;(</span><span class=\"c31\">Mega Pickin&rsquo; Symbol):</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\"><span class=\"c7\">Either reels 1/2/3, 2/3/4 or 3/4/5 will turn into a colossal symbol, which can be anything from the award card, (except scatter Bonus symbols). This symbol will cover 3 whole reels and will act the same way as if there were 9 individual symbols.&nbsp;</span>Mr Frog will activate a colossus symbol to cover either reels 1-3, 2-4 or 3-5 and will land before finishing positions have settled.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\"><strong><span class=\"c33 c36\">Random Multiplier</span><span class=\"c33\">&nbsp;(</span><span class=\"c31\">Rootin&rsquo; Tootin&rsquo; Multiplier):</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\">The frog will trigger a random multiplier for any payouts on this particular spin only.

Mr Frog will start to throw extra bonus symbols onto reels 1 and 3 during the spin. The reels will begin to slow down and grind to a halt, exposing lots of Bonuses that are now populated on reels 1 and 3. There is a 50% chance that reel 5 will then trigger the Free Spins bonus round.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\"><strong><span class=\"c33 c36\">Bonus Rewind</span><span class=\"c33\">: </span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span class=\"c7\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\">During the main game, if the Free Spins trigger symbols come in on reels 1 and 3, which in turn create an anticipation on reel 5, Mr Frog will awake and occasionally he will whistle and rewind the reel so that the Free Spins trigger symbol is activated by being visible in the reel 5 window.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\"><strong><span class=\"c33 c36\">Cash Bugs</span><span class=\"c33\">: </span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\">Mr Frog will notice bugs arriving and buzzing around the screen. Each of them will have cash prize multipliers associated to them. If Mr Frog splats one of them, it will award the player a win separate from any reel win. Wins will vary between x2 and x50 of the players current stake.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\"><strong>Frogs Free Spins:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\">On triggering the feature, the player will be awarded 14 Free Spins and 1 Super Spin. The player will be presented with a river shown from above.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\">During the Free Spins, moving objects, (lily pads and logs), will appear, moving from both left to right and right to left across the reels. The top and bottom row will have at random, logs moving right to left and the middle row will have lily pads moving left to right. If a &lsquo;Frog&rsquo; Wild symbol lands on a log or a lily pad, they will pay associated winlines but then &lsquo;stick&rsquo; on that object and float left/right accordingly per spin.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\">Wild Frogs that do not land on an object will &lsquo;splash&rsquo; into the water. They will still contribute to a winline but will spin off every spin. &lsquo;Wild Frogs&rsquo; that land on objects remain &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; (sticky) in play and<span class=\"c7\">&nbsp;travel across the reels with the log or lily pad. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span class=\"c7\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\">When the (sticky) &lsquo;Wild Frog&rsquo; symbols move off to the right or left of screen, they will be collected. All &lsquo;Wild Frog&rsquo; symbols that move off left or right of the reels will be stored, so they can enrich the &lsquo;Super Spin&rsquo; event after the final Free Spin.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c3 c38 c47\"><span class=\"c7\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;\">The amount of &lsquo;Wilds Frogs&rsquo; collected left of the screen will correlate to the amount of Wilds added to the reels for the final &lsquo;Super Spin&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n<table class=\"c9\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"c1\">\r\n<td class=\"c65\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\r\n<p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c7\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;

                "gameInfo": "<p>Hi Lo Joker is a multiple stake game with 10 different gambling choices and a part-collect option. Players will gamble on what card is drawn next. Each gamble chosen uses a specific deck of cards which consists of: 2 of Hearts, 3 of Clubs, 4 of Diamonds, 5 of Spades, 6 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 8 of Diamonds, 9 of Spades, Jack of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, King of Diamonds, Ace of Spades and a Wild Joker. The Joker in the deck is always Wild and will be a win on any bet. If the player bets that there will be a Joker card drawn next and they are correct, they will be awarded with the &ldquo;Hi Lo Joker multiplier bonus&rdquo;. This has a potential to win up to 50x the player&rsquo;s bet.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Set Your Stake</span><br />The stake can be adjusted between &pound;0.20 - &pound;100. The currently selected stake is shown centrally below the green table area and can be adjusted by pressing the plus and minus buttons to the left and right of the stake area. The stake is deducted from the current balance, which is located below the stake area, as soon as a bet has been placed.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Start the Game</span><br />Upon loading, the player will be shown the table and a first card will be drawn. At this point, the player can set their stake and once chosen can place a bet. They also have the option to swap their starting card by pressing the &ldquo;Change Card&rdquo; button, located on the deck. The betting choices are displayed to the left and right of the deck in the form of buttons with their respective odds contained within them. <br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Buttons</span><br />When the game is loaded and a starting card has been dealt, the player will be shown multiple buttons relating to types of bets and their relative return. When the player selects a bet by pressing one of these buttons, the game will begin. The stake selected will then be deducted from the player's balance. An overview of the different bets can be found below. The Joker card is Wild and substitutes for all other cards in the deck. After a betting option is chosen, the player will always win if a Joker is dealt. If the player bets higher than a Joker and a 2 is dealt, the player loses. If the player bets lower than a Joker and an Ace is dealt, again, the player loses.<br /><br /><strong><em>Joker Bonus button</em></strong><br />Located at the top-left of the play area, this is the only bet that does not show a potential return. If this bet is selected and won, the player will be awarded the &ldquo;Joker Bonus&rdquo;. A wheel will spin showing a series of multipliers. The player is then prompted to press the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; button, upon which the wheel will slow down and stop, with the multiplier that lands in the &ldquo;Win&rdquo; being paid to the player. This value can be up to 50x the player&rsquo;s stake. <br /><br /><strong><em>Hi or Lo Gamble</em></strong><br />Located directly to the right of the dealt card, Hi/Lo gives odds based on the currently drawn card. The player can choose to bet on whether the next card will be higher or lower than the dealt card. The Ace of Spades is the highest card in the deck and the 2 of Hearts the lowest card. If the player gambles on a card and the same card is dealt again, the player loses. If the player bets correctly, the return displayed within the Hi/Lo button when pressed will be paid into the Stake area. <br /><br /><em><strong>Red or Black Suit Gamble </strong></em><br />Located to the left and the right of the play area, the player can bet on the next card being either a Red suit or Black suit. There are six of each suit and returns for these bets are displayed within the respective buttons. <br /><br /><strong><em>Jack, Queen, King, Ace Gamble (JQKA) and 2-9 Gamble (Playing Cards 23456789)</em></strong><br />The player has the choice to gamble on a Jack, Queen, King or Ace or on a 2 to 9 playing card being dealt. The Joker is Wild and the player wins the gamble if this card is dealt. The value for the win is a multiple of the stake gambled and is displayed in the bet panel.<br /><br /><em><strong>Snap or Ace Gamble</strong></em><br />Snap and Ace gambles will always offer the same odds on a win. The Snap is won if the gamble card is dealt again and the Ace is won if an Ace is dealt from the pack. The Joker is Wild and the player wins the gamble if this card is dealt.<br />Note: The Snap gamble option is NOT available once a Wild Joker has been dealt. <br /><br /><em><strong>King or Ace Gamble</strong></em><br />The player has the choice to gamble on a King or an Ace playing card being dealt. The Joker is Wild and the player wins the gamble if this card is dealt.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How do you win?</span><br />When the player selects a bet with any of the above buttons, the game will begin. Losing cards will be dimmed on the card display. Winning cards will remain lit. The new card is drawn and displayed. If the player wins, the associated prize is paid into the stake area. The player then has three choices:<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Take All</span><br />This allows the player to take all of their winnings and add them to their balance.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Take Some</span><br />This allows the player to take some of their winnings and add them to their balance. The amount that is banked can be changed by pressing the plus and minus buttons that appear to the side of the &ldquo;Saved&rdquo; area when take some is pressed. The banked amounts will not be able to be used for the next round of betting.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Contiue Betting</span><br />The player can continue betting any of the betting options using a combination of their original stake and current winnings until they lose.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Payouts</span><br />All values are displayed are multipliers of the stake.</p>\r\n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG /> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--></p>\r\n<table class=\"MsoTableGrid\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

The theme is Pirates with a 'pick me' bonus feature on a secondary screen awarded  when the player reveals 3 of kind Treasure Chests.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Set Your Stake</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>The multi stake value options are 10p, &pound;1, &pound;2, &pound;3 and &pound;5. The stake value is shown in the scratch card interface. The  stake is deducted from the current balance located bottom left of the  scratch card interface when the player presses 'BUY MAP'.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Start The Game</strong></p>\r\n<p>To start the game, press the 'BUY MAP' button located to the right of the map interface. It is represented as a medallion.</p>\r\n<p>Once the 'BUY MAP' button has been selected there is a short reveal  animation displayed before the scratch card interface changes to the 'in  play' layout where the 'BUY MAP' button becomes an 'AUTO PICKS' button.</p>\r\n<p>12 Picks represented as coins are stacked to show how many picks are available.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>\r\n<p>When the 'default' scratch card interface is displayed (before the  game has been started) there is only one additional button to the 'BUY  MAP' button. This is the 'PAYTABLE' tab which is located to the right of  the scratch card interface above the 'BUY MAP' button.</p>\r\n<p>Pressing the 'PAYTABLE' tab, represented as a ribbon, will bring on  the paytable displaying the objects and values associated with finding 3  of a kind. Tapping 'CLOSE' will slide away the paytable and allow the  user access to the map selection.</p>\r\n<p>When the 'in play' interface is displayed, the 'BUY MAP' button  becomes the 'AUTO PICKS' button. Pressing the 'AUTO PICKS' button is a  turbo function and auto reveals 12 square scratch areas from the grid of  40 on the map.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Do You Win?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Once a game has started, the user picks 12 squares from the 40 grid  areas on the monochrome map. As each square is selected that area  becomes full colour and reveals either nothing or an object. The aim of  the game is to find 3 matching objects to win a cash prize. The values  of each 3 of a kind object collection are available via the 'PAYTABLE'.</p>\r\n<p>If the player fails to find 3 matching objects within the 12 picks  then it's game over. In the event of a loss (no 3 matching objects), an  'UNLUCKY Better Luck Next Time' popup is displayed briefly centrally on  the scratch interface.</p>\r\n<p>If the player finds 3 matching objects within the 12 picks then the  value/s of those 3 of a kind objects is paid to the player. In the event  of a win (once the 12 map picks are complete), the total win value from  all the matching objects is displayed briefly in a popup centrally on  the scratch card interface. The total win value is also displayed in the  'WIN' field located bottom centre of the scratch card interface. Any  win on each square is also highlighted via an animation to highlight to  the player what objects are matching.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of each game, after the win or no win panels have been  displayed, the map will fully reveal itself to show where the other  objects were located. Once the appropriate message has been displayed,  the 'default' buttons return to allow the user to play again. Pressing  the 'BUY MAP' button will start a new game.</p><p><strong>Hidden Treasures Payouts</strong></p>\r\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; mso-table-layout-alt: fixed;

Any winning lines you have will be highlighted and your winnings will be credited to your account balance.</li>\r\n<li>3 or more Bonus Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels awards The King Kong Bonus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Spinning the wheel and landing on Barrel Blast during the King Kong Bonus awards the Barrel Blast Bonus.</p>\r\n<p>Spinning the wheel and landing on King Kong Trail during the King Kong Bonus awards the King Kong Trail Bonus.</p>\r\n<p>Spinning the wheel and landing on Empire Free Spins during the King Kong Bonus awards the Empire Free Spins Bonus.</p>\r\n<p>Spinning the wheel and landing on Golden Kong Free Spins during the King Kong Bonus awards the Golden Kong Free Spins Bonus.</p>\r\n<p>Spinning the wheel and landing on BIG MONEY during the King Kong Bonus awards the BIG MONEY Bonus.</p><p><strong>Reel Wins</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Line wins are multiplied by the value bet on the winning line.</li>\r\n<li>All Wins across all different lines are added together to form the total win.</li>\r\n<li>All line pay symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive lines beginning with the far left reel.</li>\r\n<li>Only the highest line win is paid on each line.</li>\r\n<li>Scatter wins are added to any line wins.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>The Wild(s) symbol can be used to help form line wins by substituting for other symbols.</li>\r\n<li>The Wild(s) symbol cannot substitute for scatter symbols or bonus symbols.</li>\r\n<li>Only the highest paying win on each line is paid (for example 3 wild symbols being a win or those symbols being used with another symbol to make a win of 4 symbols will only pay which of those two is the highest).</li>\r\n<li>Wild symbols include: Banana Cannon Wilds, Empire Spin Roaming Wilds, and Standard Wilds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Sleepy Kong</strong></p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>If Kong wakes from his slumber during any game there is chance the Sleepy Kong Bonus can be triggered.</li>\r\n<li>Kong will leap from his throne, where he can and award one of the following features:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Banana Cannon Wilds</strong>&nbsp;- Whilst the reels spin Kong shall jump up from his throne with a banana cannon and fire a sticky banana bomb at the centre reel position, which then explodes turning additional positions wild. After any wins have been processed occasionally Kong shall jump up and smash the ground causing the reels to respin holding any wilds in position.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Golden Barrel Super Spin</strong>&nbsp;- Whilst the reels spin, Kong will awaken from his slumber and throw a Golden Barrel at the centre of the reels. This causes an explosion over the top of the reels which adds a number of Golden Barrels to the reels. Once the reels have landed all the golden barrels in view shall explode and reveal the same symbol.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>King Kong Spin Streak&nbsp;</strong>-Once the reels have stopped and presented a combination of winning symbols occasionally Kong can jump up from his throne and begin beating the reels with a wooden mallet. This will cause the reels to respin holding the trigger symbols in position. This will continue until the win is not improved.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Bonus Boost </strong>-Similar to Golden Barrel Super Spin &ndash; Rather than adding a number of Golden Barrels to the reels the explosion will add a number of additional bonus symbols to the reels. This significantly increases the chance of triggering the bonus on that spin.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bonus Activation</strong></p>\r\n<p>The player enters the bonus by achieving 3 or more bonus symbols anywhere in view. There is no payout awarded directly for getting this, just entry to one of the bonus rounds.</p>\r\n<p>There will be 5 unique bonuses which will be determined by the King Kong Bonus.</p>\r\n<p>The player will spin the wheel, which after a spinning will stop on one of 5 features, revealing the bonus that has been awarded.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Barrel Blast Bonus</strong></p>\r\n<p>Triggered by landing on the Barrel Blast segment of the wheel during the King Kong Bonus.</p>\r\n<p>After a short transition, a scene will be shown with a number of Barrels on screen along with a winplan to the left.</p>\r\n<p>The player selects barrels to reveal an item. Each item will match up to a total bet multiplier, which is paid for matching 3 of the same item. Additionally, revealing a special icon will upgrade the total bet multipliers, and collecting 3 Golden Monkeys shall award the King Kong Cash BIG MONEY Bonus.</p>\r\n<p><strong>King Kong Trail Bonus</strong></p>\r\n<p>After a short screen transition the player will be presented with a secondary bonus screen that is themed on the retro style platform game.</p>\r\n<p>The bonus shall be split into two stages; Stage 1 is a multiplier trail up the levels to the King Kong Cash BIG MONEY Bonus (stage 2).</p>\r\n<p>The player always begins in stage 1 and is required to select barrels in order to advance along the trail increasing the total bet multiplier. Selecting the barrels will reveal one of the following positive or negative outcomes:-</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"225\">\r\n<p><strong>Event</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"213\">\r\n<p><strong>Action</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"225\">\r\n<p>Advance 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"213\">\r\n<p>Will action Kong to move up the trail by the corresponding number of Windows.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"225\">\r\n<p>Golden Monkey</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"213\">\r\n<p>Takes the player directly to the King Kong Cash BIG MONEY Bonus part of the feature.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"225\">\r\n<p>Bomb</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"213\">\r\n<p>Ends the bonus and pays the current total bet multiplier.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>If the King Kong Cash BIG MONEY Bonus end game is reached, Kong enters the big money end game. Here the player is presented with Kong in the centre of the screen surrounded by a carousel of barrels along with bananas down the left and right sides of the screen.</p>\r\n<p>The Barrels will spin and then come to a stop awarding the corresponding total bet multiplier. The player will then be prompted to pick a banana from either side of the carousel, revealing either a Golden Monkey (which respins the barrels and adds to the bonus win) or a Bomb which ends the feature, awarding the player the overall Total Bet Multiplier achieved.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Empire Free Spins</strong></p>\r\n<p>Triggered by landing on the Empire Free Spins segment of the wheel during the King Kong Bonus.</p>\r\n<p>A screen transition will occur and the player will be taken to a new destination, the top of the Empire State Building with multiple reels in view.</p>\r\n<p>The screen will start at the top, before the screen pans down the other reel sets, which display the reels, and a side banner detailing the upgrade for that reel set.</p>\r\n<p>The player is then presented with the bottom level. Here the player will play out their set of free spins on this reel set. The object of the Free Spins round is to collect Golden Monkeys which appear randomly on the reel symbols. By collecting a number of Golden Monkeys this then advances the player up to the next reel set. The further the player levels up, the more powerful the upgrade awarded.</p>\r\n<p>As the player gets higher up, additional spins are awarded.</p>\r\n<p>Free Spins continue until all spins are used where the player is awarded the amount displayed in Bonus Winnings. Additional free spins are awarded each time the player completes a level.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Golden Kong Free Spins</strong></p>\r\n<p>Triggered by landing on the Golden Kong Free Spins segment of the wheel during the King Kong Bonus.</p>\r\n<p>Golden Kong Free Spins are played out on a 5x4 reel format with 40 win lines and a fixed amount of Free Spins. After each spin if any special wild symbols land in view a wild bank panel situated on the right-hand side of the screen will be incremented by the corresponding number of wilds. Once the initial round of Free Spins end the player will then be awarded a series of &lsquo;Wild Spins&rsquo;. Wild Spins play out on the same reel set and during each spin the accumulated number of wilds shall be placed randomly on to the reels. After a spin ends the player will be presented with 3 barrels over the top of the reels and prompted to select a barrel revealing either a Golden Donkey (Spins the reels again with the wilds shuffled to new positions) or a Bomb which ends the feature.</p>\r\n<p>Golden Kong Free Spins cannot be retriggered during Golden Kong Free Spins. During Wild Spins, additional spins may be awarded.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Feature Gamble</strong></p>\r\n<p>Whenever a Feature win is achieved in the game, the player has the option to either COLLECT the feature or Gamble to try and win one of the other features in the game (except for BIG MONEY Bonus).</p>\r\n<p>After the award of the initial Bonus from the wheel spin during the King Kong Bonus, the player will be presented with a Gamble screen showing the 5 features from bottom to top, ranked in terms of average payout. The feature the player has won will be shown to the player with the words COLLECT and GAMBLE shown on the feature panel in the centre of the screen.</p>\r\n<p>If the player gambles and win, the feature they have gambled to can be collected, with all features below that now eliminated. This continues until the player collects, reached the top feature (where it awards that feature) or the player lands on the Mystery Win segment during the wheel spin where they are then awarded a Mystery Win Prize (a mystery cash value based on a multiplier of the player's total bet).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Auto Play</strong></p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>There is an Autoplay function in the game that will start each spin automatically.</li>\r\n<li>By selecting 'AUTOPLAY' you can choose to place up to 100 bets automatically, one after the other.</li>\r\n<li>Select your stake as normal then press the 'AUTOPLAY' button to select the number of 'Autoplay' bets you want to play.</li>\r\n<li>Select your Loss Limit (maximum amount willing to lose for the autoplay session) and then press PLAY to begin your autoplays (other options are available).</li>\r\n<li>Auto Play will turn off if you get into any bonus round including Freespins, if you reach the set Loss Limit or if a Progressive pot is awarded (where applicable).</li>\r\n<li>You can stop Auto Play from continuing onto the next spin by clicking the 'STOP' button.</li>\r\n</ul><p><strong>Payout Information and Game Rules</strong></p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Line wins are multiplied by the value bet on the winning line.</li>\r\n<li>Wins on different paylines are added.</li>\r\n<li>All line pay symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels beginning with the far left reel (20 lines always active except Golden Kong Free Spins where 40 winlines are always active). Only the highest line win is paid on each line.</li>\r\n<li>Feature symbols are scatter wins and are awarded when appearing on any position on the reels for any number of played lines.</li>\r\n<li>Multiple scatter features can be won in a single game.</li>\r\n<li>Scatter wins are paid in addition to reel wins.</li>\r\n<li>Free Spins are played on the same number of lines and bet per line/Total Bet as the triggering game (20 lines always active except Golden Kong Free Spins where 40 winlines are always active).</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The maximum win from a single game is &pound;250,000 or 10,000xBet - whichever is reached first (depending on currency.

                "gameInfo": "<p>Pan For Gold is a &pound;2 instant win scratch card game with a &pound;25k Jackpot. The game is based on finding gems and gold. The theme is the gold rush of the Wild West.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Set Your Stake</strong></p>\r\n<p>The stake value is set for each card and cannot be adjusted. The stake value (&pound;2) is shown on the bottom right of the scratch card interface and on the BUY CARD button. The stake is deducted from the current balance, which is located on the bottom left of the scratch card interface.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Start the Game</strong></p>\r\n<p>A tutorial on how to play will be shown after loading the game. The player will be briefly introduced to a map which will zoom into the &lsquo;Goldville&rsquo; area to enter the game, where a prospector sits beside a river. Pressing the &lsquo;BUY CARD&rsquo; button represented as a gold sheriff&rsquo;s badge (located to the right of the paytable) will start the game. Once the &lsquo;BUY CARD&rsquo; button has been selected the pan will be dunked 3 times to find gems and gold.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>\r\n<p>Before the game has been started, there is a &lsquo;BUY CARD&rsquo; button represented as a gold sheriff's badge. There is also a &lsquo;BACK TO MAP&rsquo; button which takes the player back to the map so they can navigate to 5 other areas.</p>\r\n<p>After purchasing a card, the 'GO!' button will start the game.</p>\r\n<p>On supported mobile devices, the player can then either shake the device or swipe the screen to shake the pan so that the silt and water disappears. When the game is played on a desktop computer, the player will be prompted to click and drag to empty the pan.</p>\r\n<p>If the player selects the 'Turbo' option, the contents of the pan will be revealed automatically.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Do You Win?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Once a game has started, the player will be introduced to a map which will zoom into the &lsquo;Goldville&rsquo; area to enter the game. A prospector sits beside a river, and the player is prompted to buy a card.</p>\r\n<p>When the card has been purchased, the player will be prompted to &lsquo;Pan for Gold&rsquo;. The &lsquo;in play&rsquo; interface is displayed and the player is shown two ways to reveal the gems and gold in the pan. This message interface is only shown once as a guide to the player on how to do panning actions. The player has 3 dunks to try and find gems and gold. This is done by shaking the device or swiping the screen vigorously (on supported mobile devices) or clicking and dragging the pan around (on desktop),&nbsp;to remove the water and silt from the pan to reveal items. If the player finds a gem in the pan then this is added to the paytable which appears between dunks. If the player fills 3 of-a-kind gems during the dunks, then the corresponding win is awarded. If the player reveals more than 3 of the same gems, then the 3 gems are awarded and the following gems re-populate the paytable progressing towards another win. Several wins on the paytable can be offered at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>During game play, golden nuggets may be available for collection. If the player finds a golden nugget this is then added into the Golden Nugget pot at the side of the paytable. These golden nuggets stay persistent between each purchase of a scratch card. Collect 8 golden nuggets to enter the &lsquo;BANK&rsquo; bonus feature.</p>\r\n<p>Upon collecting 8 nuggets, the &lsquo;BANK&rsquo; ticket icon will flash to show the player that the &lsquo;BANK&rsquo; bonus has been activated and the golden nuggets in the paytable will clear down. If the Golden Nugget pot has been filled with 8 nuggets, and there are more found during subsequent pans, the Golden Nugget pot clears down and begins repopulating with additional golden nuggets. These contribute towards the next &lsquo;BANK&rsquo; bonus.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Base game payouts</strong></p>\r\n<p>Turquoise Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;2</p>\r\n<p>Orange Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;4</p>\r\n<p>Dark Green Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;10</p>\r\n<p>Pink Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;20</p>\r\n<p>Blue Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;50</p>\r\n<p>Purple Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;100</p>\r\n<p>Red Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;500</p>\r\n<p>Green Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;1,000</p>\r\n<p>Citrine Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;5,000</p>\r\n<p>Pearl Gem<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> - </span>&pound;25,000</p>\r\n<p>All currencies are expressed in GBP.

The gold nuggets are loaded in one side and coins then load into the other to balance the scales. After the scales are levelled, the gold has been weighed and the player is given the amount the &lsquo;BANK&rsquo; has offered.</p>\r\n<p>Please note: The player can collect 8 nuggets and enter the &lsquo;BANK&rsquo; bonus without having achieved a win on the panning section of the game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BANK Bonus - Mystery Win Values</strong></p>\r\n<p>&pound;4, &pound;10, &pound;20, &pound;50, &pound;100, &pound;200, &pound;1000, &pound;5,000, &pound;25,000</p><p><strong>Game Recovery</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the event of a game in real play being interrupted (i.e. started but not completed due to connectivity issues or accidentally closing the browser etc), any winnings will be correctly credited to your account and will be exact according to the result prior to the game being interrupted.</p>\r\n<p>The sequence and values of events leading to the display of the total award, may vary from the animation prior to game recovery.

After any wins have been processed occasionally Panda shall jump up and kick the reels causing the reels to respin holding any wilds in position.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Belly Smash</strong>&nbsp;- Whilst the reels spin Panda shall wake up and belly smash the reels creating a stacked wild. All 5 reels can be made wild.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Golden Super Spin</strong>&nbsp;- As the reels continue to spin, Panda will awake and use his mind trick to add mystery symbols to the reels. These can turn into any other symbol.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Eye of the Panda</strong>&nbsp;- Once the reels have stopped and presented a combination of winning symbols occasionally Panda will awake and use his Ninja mind trick. This will cause the reels to respin holding the trigger symbols in position. This will continue until the win is not improved.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Panda Mind Trick</strong>&nbsp;- On any spin Panda can add more Bonus symbols to the reels. This significantly increases the chance of triggering the bonus on that spin.</p>\r\n<h2><u>Bonus Activation</u></h2>\r\n<p>The player enters the bonus by achieving 3 or more bonus symbols anywhere in view.

In addition to the wilds roaming around the reels, now when two wild symbols &lsquo;collide&rsquo; on the same reel position it shall award a win multiplier ranging from x2 to x5.</p>\r\n<p>Level 3 (final) - When any special wild symbol lands in view it would act as a standard wild symbol by substituting any other symbol, but then on every subsequent spin the &lsquo;wild&rsquo; will roam around the reels to a different position. In addition to the wilds roaming around the reels, now when two wild symbols &lsquo;collide&rsquo; on the same position the special wild symbol shall expand to cover the entire reel.</p>\r\n<p>The player is then presented with the bottom level. Here the player will play out their set of free spins on this reel set. The object of the Free Spins round is to collect Yin Yang icons which appear randomly on the reel symbols. By collecting a number of Yin Yangs this then advances the player up to the next reel set. The further the player levels up, the more powerful the upgrade awarded.</p>\r\n<p>As the player gets higher up, additional spins are awarded.</p>\r\n<p>Free Spins continue until all spins are used where the player is awarded the amount displayed in Bonus Winnings.

After each spin if any special wild symbols land in view a wild bank panel situated on the right-hand side of the screen will be incremented by the corresponding number of wilds. Once the initial round of Free Spins end the player will then be awarded a series of &lsquo;Wild Spins&rsquo;. Wild Spins play out on the same reel set and during each spin the accumulated number of wilds shall be placed randomly on to the reels. After a spin ends the player will be presented with 4 lanterns over the top of the reels and prompted to select a lantern revealing either a Yin Yang (Spins the reels again with the wilds shuffled to new positions) or a Collect which ends the feature.</p>\r\n<p>Panda Warrior Free Spins cannot be retriggered during Panda Warrior Free Spins. During Wild Spins, additional spins may be awarded.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Enter The Panda - Big Money Bonus</strong></p>\r\n<p>Collecting 5 Bonus symbols, gambling to, or having landed on the Big Money Bonus on the Bonus Wheel triggers the Big Money Bonus.</p>\r\n<p>Here the player will be presented with numerous different amounts in orbs where the orbs will spin around the Panda.

                "gameInfo": "<p>Power Gems is a 10 winline 5X3 slot game. The game features stacked gem symbols, 1 bonus feature and &lsquo;Wild Power Respin&rsquo; modifiers.</p>\r\n<p>The bonus feature is a &lsquo;Winspins&rsquo; round where players will win a specific number of Winspins. However, these will be natural free spins until the player achieves 10 winning spins. Each losing spin will increment a multiplier, so that when a player does get a winning spin, it could be at a far higher multiplier.</p>\r\n<p>Each press of PLAY will action each reel to spin to a random position. Wins are paid for matching all 3, 4 or 5 of-a-kind symbols.</p>\r\n<p>All wins are paid both from left to right and right to left on any payline.</p>\r\n<p>All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left or the far right.</p>\r\n<p>All wins shown on different winlines will be processed and paid to the player.</p>\r\n<p>During a normal spin, Wild symbols will only appear on reels 2, 3, 4.</p>\r\n<p>The Wild symbol can substitute for ALL other symbols EXCEPT scatter symbols to help create a line win. Using a Wild symbol to complete a line does not incur any extra multiplier other than the win for the symbol(s) it substitutes. Only the highest paying win on each line will be counted.</p>\r\n<p>During the base game,the Wild symbol will become a modifier, and trigger a &lsquo;Power Respin&rsquo; after winnings have been settled.</p><p><strong>Set Your Stake</strong></p>\r\n<p>The player can choose their stake by pressing the + &amp; - buttons on the left of the screen. The stake will be shown in the Total Stake meter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\r\n<p>Wild Modifiers: During the main game, there will be &lsquo;Wild Modifiers&rsquo; available that trigger if any Wilds land on reels 2, 3 and 4. If triggered, the player is given a respin without taking a credit and the Wild event animates one of the following:</p>\r\n<p>1. Wild becomes &lsquo;Wild Reel&rsquo; and gives a respin with Wild Reel</p>\r\n<p>2. Wild becomes an extended &lsquo;Colossus Wild&rsquo; of a 2x2 reel size</p>\r\n<p>3. Wild becomes an extended &lsquo;Colossus Wild&rsquo; of 3x3 reel size</p>\r\n<p>4. Wild remains but shoots a number of random Wilds onto the reels</p>\r\n<p>5. Wild remains but respin triggers the feature</p>\r\n<p>Bonus Scatter Symbols: These symbols will trigger the bonus Winspins feature and appear on reels 1 and 5 only. If a scatter symbol lands on reels 1, it will trigger an anticipation on the final reel. These bonus symbols are designed so they look like they are &lsquo;half symbols&rsquo; which join to trigger the Winspins bonus feature. Bonus scatter symbols are NOT present during the Winspins bonus feature.</p>\r\n<p>Winspins Bonus Feature: The feature is a Winspins experience that plays out as random spins. The feature will only finish once 10 winning spins have been concluded, (unless accompanied with the &lsquo;Bonus trigger&rsquo;, which awards an additional 10 Winspins!). All wins will be relative to current total stake and the base game paytable. Each losing spin will increment the multiplier by 1 until a winning spin is achieved. The multiplier will be applied to the next winning spin, and reset to X1.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>\r\n<p>Pressing the rotating arrow icon, above the &lsquo;PLAY&rsquo; arrow button, will open a dialogue panel from which the player can access the autoplay options.</p>\r\n<p>Pressing the &lsquo;menu&rsquo; button icon, on the right-hand side above the &lsquo;Autoplay&rsquo; button, will open the information from which the player can access the paytable information. The player can press the arrows back and forth to access all other game information. Pressing the &lsquo;X&rsquo; button will exit the information and return the player to the main game interface.</p>\r\n<p>Accessing the &lsquo;cog&rsquo; button will allow the player access to toggle the sounds on/off and, on compatible devices, the player can also turn on/off the vibrate function. On launch of the game, the default setting will be ON for both of these options.</p>\r\n<p>+ &amp; - buttons on &lsquo;Total Stake&rsquo; adjust the player's total stake on each spin.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Paytable</strong></p>\r\n<p>Only the highest win per bet line is paid.</p>\r\n<p>Line wins will pay from left to right and from right to left.</p>\r\n<p>Adjustment of the stake will dynamically alter the awards in the paytable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Game Recovery</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the event of a game in real play being interrupted, (i.e. started but not completed due to connectivity issues or accidentally closing the browser, etc.), depending on the previous state of the game, it will either resume from the point of the last spin or display the outcome of the game already in play. The current multiplier on that stake will also be displayed.</p>\r\n<p>Any winnings will be correctly credited to the player account and will be exact according to the result prior to the game being interrupted.</p><p><strong>General Information</strong></p>\r\n<p>This game has a theoretical Return to Player (RTP) of 95.02%.</p>\r\n<p>The maximum payout is the capped amount of &pound;250,000</p>\r\n<p>System malfunction voids all pays and all plays.</p>\r\n<p>Due to high production values of this game, lower-tier hardware may run into compatibility issues and, in certain instances, you will not be able to play.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>\r\n<p>&copy; 2017 CORE Gaming Limited.

There are also 3 reel based features and a reel modifying bonus spin.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Playing the game&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Each press of SPIN will action each reel to spin to a random position. Wins are paid for matching 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of-a-kind symbols dependant on stake from the centre 3 reels out on any payline.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Set Your Stake</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The player can choose their stake by pressing the plus and minus buttons on the right of the screen. The stake will be shown in the Total Stake meter.</li>\r\n<li>There are nine stake levels the player can select. Each level has a dedicated amount of winlines and an amount of reels to play against every particular stake. The player can choose to play 3, 5 or 7 reels with between 5 and 50 winlines, depending on stake.</li>\r\n<li>The relating winlines and the amount of reels are dictated on each stake level.</li>\r\n<li>During normal game play, the reels are always going to stop from the centre out, whether on 3, 5 or 7 reels.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There are WILD leopard skin symbols which substitute for all symbols, except scatters.</li>\r\n<li>Arranged at the top of reels are 3 progressive jackpots. Each of the progressive jackpots increment according to the stake level being played on. On occasion the player will be shown the Jackpot screen with a thermometer on a volcano. The Jackpot will only be awarded if the lava within the thermometer passes the RED line.</li>\r\n<li>The Jackpots are as follows:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Bronze Jackpot:</strong> Increments from stake level 1-9, seeded at &pound;3,000.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Silver Jackpot:</strong> Increments from stake level 4-9, seeded at &pound;10,000.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Gold Jackpot: </strong>&nbsp;Increments from stake level 7-9, seeded at &pound;20,000.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There are three bonus features and also a base game reel modifier. The features are Diplo Dollars, Ice Age Freeze Spins and Walk The Dinosaur, with the modifier entitled Dinomite.</li>\r\n<li>When the three trigger dinosaur egg symbols land in view, one of the eggs will hatch, revealing a Free Spins bonus to the player. Either Diplo Dollars, Ice Age Freeze Spins or Walk The Dinosaur will be awarded. These are attributed to a particular 'feature' egg, so that the player will be able to know which bonus will be given.</li>\r\n<li>The eggs will be dedicated to the last three reels, ranging from the right, i.e. on 7 reels, the eggs will appear on reels 5, 6 and 7.</li>\r\n<li>These features are NOT available during the Bone-Us upgrade.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Walk The Dinosaur:</strong> This is a Free Spins feature. These are Walking Wild Spins with the Wild initially appearing on the very last reel, on the right-hand side. This Walking Wilds feature has &ldquo;Sliding Wilds&rdquo; and the Wild Spins keep going provided a Wild is in view on the reels. After any win has been paid from the initial spin, before the next spin, the Wilds will slide across the screen to the left until they leave the furthest left reel. Additional Wilds can appear during Wild Spins, which will trigger more Free Spins. This feature applies to each of the 1-9 stake levels, so this feature will be applicable to 3, 5 or 7 reels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Diplo Dollars:</strong> Free Spins Feature which can award 5 to 20 Free Spins at random. The reels contain Stacked Wilds and also there is a random multiplier occasionally applied between x2 and x5.

The reels freeze/lock with Stacked Wilds for the duration of the Free Spins event. There is a chance of between 6-50 Spins being awarded. The centre reel always is frozen with Stacked Wilds and, on the 7 reel level, also the outer reels left and right have frozen Stacked Wilds too.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Secondary Bonuses</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Bone-Us Upgrade:</strong> During any normal base game spin, there is a random chance that from stake levels 1-6, the player will be upgraded and be given between 1 and 8 Free Spins at a higher level. This will include the upgrading of the amount of reels, winlines and, therefore, paytable wins. There is a bespoke upgrade chance for each level below level 7. These are improving the higher the level is. A player can only upgrade +3 or +6 levels where possible. During these Free Spins, it is not possible to win any of the bonus features.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dinomite:</strong> During any base game spin, there is a chance that the cave girl character will appear. She will ignite a &ldquo;Dinomite&rdquo; symbol, summon on the full set of 7 reels and blow up a set of at least 4 symbols. This will add a Colossal Wild set of symbols to the reels. The extra Wilds are fixed over the spinning reels and will remain for one game only. Once the reels have stopped, any wins will be paid as normal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pressing the rotating arrow icon, above the Spin button, will open a dialogue panel from which the player can access the auto plays adjuster.</li>\r\n<li>Pressing the &lsquo;menu&rsquo; icon, on the right-hand side below the spin button, will open the menu from which the player can access the Paytable information.

These symbol positions will then turn into extra large &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; symbols covering more than one reel.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wild Reels modifier</strong>: During the main game, on random occasions, Rosella, during the reel spins, will use her magic and cast a spell on particular reel apertures. These whole reels will then become &lsquo;Wild&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lucky Wilds modifier</strong>: During the main game, on random occasions, Rosella, during the reel spins, will use her magic and cast a spell on particular symbol positions. These symbol positions will then turn into &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; symbols which, if they create a connecting win, will pay x7 of that win.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Big Win modifier</strong>: During the main game, on random occasions, a modifier can alter the reels and spin in a guaranteed &lsquo;Big Win&rsquo; (x20 of base game stake).</p>\r\n<p>During the base game, should a player get 3 scattered bonus symbols on reels 1, 3 and 5, they will trigger one of the Free Spin progressive bonus pots.

These Free Spins progressive bonus pots will keep incrementing until they have been triggered by the dedicated symbols landing during a bonus scatter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Multipliers' Free Spins feature</strong>: The win multiplier starts at 1 and increments after each Free Spin plays. So, for 10 Free Spins, the multiplier on each spin will be x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10. Any win awarded is multiplied by the multiplier for that spin. This process will continue for the amount of Free Spins left with the multiplier incrementing on each and every Free Spin. The Free Spins will count down from the amount of Free Spins incremented during the base game play until there are no more Free Spins available. Once Free Spins is over, the pot will reset to the seeded amount.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Wild Reels' Free Spins feature</strong>: An overlay of a Wild Reel is locked onto one or more the reels during each spin. The reel set spins on those reels not obscured by a column of Wilds. The Free Spins will count down from the amount of Free Spins incremented during the base game play until there are no more Free Spins available. Once Free Spins is over, the pot will reset to the seeded amount.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Colossal Wild' Free Spins feature</strong>: Extra large colossal Wilds Spin with the standard reel set. These can cover 2x2 or 3x3 reel positions. The Free Spins will count down from the amount of Free Spins incremented during the base game play until there are no more Free Spins available.

Now on mobile!</p>\r\n<p>● Your winnings will be credited to your account immediately.</p>\r\n<p>● You will lose your stake amount if you lose the game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Set Your Stake</strong></p>\r\n<p>● Select the stake by tapping on a suitable chip from the Chip Selector. The selected chip is indicated by a white highlight around the chip. All other chips are dulled in appearance.</p>\r\n<p>● It is possible to mix chip values on the same bet. To see the available chip values, tap the &lsquo;back&rsquo; and &lsquo;next&rsquo; arrow buttons located to the left and right of the Chip Selector respectively to cycle down or up the values, until the minimum or maximum chip value is reached.</p>\r\n<p>● The total stake value when bets have been placed is displayed above the Chip Selector on the right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Please note the maximum stake per hand on Sky Blackjack is &pound;5,000&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Placing a Bet</strong></p>\r\n<p>● The two circles located towards the bottom of the bet cloth are betting areas (&lsquo;seats&rsquo;) for a hand of Blackjack. Choose between one and two hands to play by tapping within either betting area to place a chip of the selected value for that seat.</p>\r\n<p>● If there are no bets placed on a seat, that seat will glow to indicate to the player where bets can be placed.</p>\r\n<p>● Each additional tap will add one unit of the selected chip value to that bet.</p>\r\n<p>● When a bet is placed, a tooltip is displayed briefly above the placed bet to show the total bet value for that seat (in local currency).</p>\r\n<p>● When a bet has been placed, the &lsquo;Undo&rsquo;, &lsquo;Clear&rsquo; and &lsquo;Deal&rsquo; buttons will become active.</p>\r\n<p>● Tapping the 'Clear' button located bottom left of the bet cloth, will remove all bets from the table.</p>\r\n<p>● Tapping the 'Undo' button located above the 'Clear' button will remove the last bet placed.</p>\r\n<p>Tapping again will remove the next bet, and so on until all placed bets have been removed.</p>\r\n<p>● While there are no bets on the bet cloth, the &lsquo;Undo&rsquo;, Clear&rsquo; and &lsquo;Deal&rsquo; buttons will be de-activated.</p>\r\n<p>● Following a game, the &lsquo;Clear&rsquo; button is replaced with a &lsquo;New&rsquo; button, the &lsquo;Undo&rsquo; button is removed, the &lsquo;Rebet and Deal&rsquo; button becomes active and the &lsquo;Deal&rsquo; button is replaced with a &lsquo;Rebetx2 and Deal&rsquo; button.</p>\r\n<p>● The &lsquo;Rebetx2 and Deal&rsquo; button and &lsquo;Rebet and Deal&rsquo; buttons are only active if the player has sufficient funds to replace or double (in the case of Rebetx2 and Deal) the previous bet for each active seat (and doing so does not breach the maximum bet limits).</p>\r\n<p>● Tapping the &lsquo;New&rsquo; button will remove all cards from the table and revert the game to its initial state, the &lsquo;Rebet and Deal&rsquo; button will remain active however (providing the player has sufficient funds).</p>\r\n<p>● Tapping either the &lsquo;Rebet and Deal&rsquo; or &lsquo;Rebetx2 and Deal&rsquo; buttons will replace or double (in the case of Rebetx2 and Deal) the previous bets for each active seat and start the game in the same way as tapping the &lsquo;Deal&rsquo; button.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Start The Game</strong></p>\r\n<p>● When all bets have been placed, tapping the &lsquo;Deal&rsquo; button located bottom right will remove the button interface and Chip Selector and the cards will be dealt when the result is returned from the server.</p>\r\n<p>● If either seat has no placed bets, it will no longer be highlighted until the game has been reset.</p>\r\n<p>● A card is dealt from the &lsquo;hopper&rsquo;, top right of the bet cloth to each active seat in turn followed by the dealer until each active seat and the dealer have two cards each.</p>\r\n<p>● The seat cards are dealt face up with the values showing, whereas the first dealer card (the &lsquo;hole&rsquo; card) remains face down.</p>\r\n<p>● The seat being played is indicated by a spotlight over that seat.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Game In Play</strong></p>\r\n<p>● Once all cards have been dealt, the initial button interface is replaced with the in play button interface.</p>\r\n<p>● During play, the &lsquo;Hint&rsquo; lightbulb icon button located top left of the game window may become active (indicated by a highlight) to offer the player advice or further information on the current active seat. Tapping the &lsquo;Hint&rsquo; button will display a dialogue box centrally on the bet cloth containing the relevant advice. Tapping the &lsquo;Close&rsquo; button located top right of the dialogue box will close the dialogue box.</p>\r\n<p>● If the total hand value (on two cards) of either active player seat is 21, the result is confirmed as &lsquo;Blackjack&rsquo; and the play skips automatically to the next active seat or dealer.</p>\r\n<p>● If the dealer&rsquo;s &lsquo;up&rsquo; card is an Ace, the player is invited to take insurance for each active seat by selecting either the &lsquo;Insure&rsquo; or &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Insure&rsquo; buttons located to the right and left of the bet cloth respectively.</p>\r\n<p>● Following the offer of insurance (or if the dealer&rsquo;s up card is not an Ace), the first player seat must choose whether to stand, hit, double or split by selecting the &lsquo;Stand&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hit&rsquo;, &lsquo;Double&rsquo; or &lsquo;Split&rsquo; buttons located to the right and left of the bet cloth respectively.</p>\r\n<p>● The player continues to play the active seat until either the &lsquo;Stand&rsquo; button is selected or the player busts. If the total hand value of a player seat reaches 21 on three cards, the result is automatically confirmed as a stand and play skips automatically to the next active seat or dealer.</p>\r\n<p>● The total hand value of each player seat is displayed in a tooltip bottom left of each hand and updates as subsequent cards are dealt. If the total value exceeds 21, the tooltip breaks showing the word &lsquo;Bust&rsquo; and the final hand value.</p>\r\n<p>● If a player seat busts, the player loses the bet for that seat once the dealer hand has been played.</p>\r\n<p>● When both player seats have been played, the dealer&rsquo;s hole card is shown. The dealer will continue to draw cards until either the dealer busts or the total hand value is equal to or over 17.</p>\r\n<p>If the total hand value of the dealer is higher than either active player seat total hand value, the dealer wins that hand and the relevant player bet.</p>\r\n<p>● If a player seat hand matches the dealer hand, the result is a &lsquo;push&rsquo; and the relevant player bet is returned to the player.</p>\r\n<p>Please note: The advice offered during play (accessed via the &lsquo;Hint&rsquo; button when available), in no way guarantees a successful outcome for the player, it should be used solely to assist in understanding the standard Blackjack strategy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Special Plays</strong></p>\r\n<p>Special plays will appear as buttons to the left and right of the bet cloth during the course of a game, when the player has the option to play them. The following special plays are featured:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Insurance</strong></p>\r\n<p>If the dealer&rsquo;s up card is an Ace, the player is invited to take insurance for each active seat. If the player accepts insurance, the dealer will check (&lsquo;peek&rsquo;) at the hole card for Blackjack.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Split</strong></p>\r\n<p>If the player&rsquo;s first two cards are of identical value, they may split them and place an additional bet (equal to the original bet) to play two hands instead of one.</p>\r\n<p>If a pair of Aces is split, each Ace is dealt one card and then the hand automatically stands.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Double</strong></p>\r\n<p>This allows the player to double their bet and receive just one more card per seat, forfeiting the opportunity to hit further. The third dealt card is placed horizontally (rather than vertically) on top of the other two cards.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Double after Split</strong></p>\r\n<p>Once the player has split their identical value cards into two hands and received a second card for each, the option is available to double down on those two hands. Each hand is played out separately and the option is available on one or both hands.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Two Aces</strong></p>\r\n<p>If the first two cards are aces, the player does not win the hand. Instead, it forms a total hand of either 12 or 2. The player is permitted to split aces, but only once.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Soft</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is displayed alongside an ace when the hand is low enough for the ace to be assigned its higher value (11) without going bust. The player can always draw at least one card to a soft hand without busting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>\r\n<p>● Tapping the &lsquo;Settings&rsquo; cog button will automatically open a dialogue panel from which the player can access game rules, information and best strategy. This panel will also contain function controls such as table colour selection, switching voice or table sounds on or off and turning automatic hints on or off.</p>\r\n<p>● Once within the rules section, tapping the &lsquo;Next&rsquo; and &lsquo;Back&rsquo; buttons located to the right of the screen will navigate forward and backward respectively. Tapping the &lsquo;Exit&rsquo; button will return to the main game interface.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Do You Win?</strong></p>\r\n<p>● If the dealer busts only, the player wins the game.</p>\r\n<p>● If the total hand value of a player seat is higher than the dealer hand without going over 21, the player wins.</p>\r\n<p>● If a winning player hand is from a split hand, the player wins &lsquo;evens&rsquo; on the relevant bet for that hand.</p>\r\n<p>● On a win, a win tooltip is displayed above the total hand value tooltip on the relevant player seat showing the total win value for that seat. A larger win banner is also displayed centrally on the bet cloth showing the total win value for all seats.</p>\r\n<p>● At the same time as the win tooltip and win banner are displayed, chips for the total win value for each seat travel from the dealer to the relevant hand, stopping briefly before travelling off the bottom of the game interface.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>\r\n<p>● The dealer peeks on Aces.</p>\r\n<p>● The dealer must stand on a hard 17 and soft 17.</p>\r\n<p>● Splits are allowed on equal value of cards.</p>\r\n<p>● Blackjack cannot be called on a split hand. The player may &lsquo;double&rsquo; on the first hand consisting of two cards with a total card value of 9, 10 or 11.</p>\r\n<p>● The player may double after a split.</p>\r\n<p>● The player may not hit after a double.</p>\r\n<p>● The player may not hit on split aces.</p>\r\n<p>● The player may split only once per hand to create two separate hands, there can be no re-splitting.</p>\r\n<p>● The player may not take a surrender or late surrender on any cards</p>\r\n<p>● If the player&rsquo;s hand does not exceed 21 after receiving eleven cards, the hand automatically stands.</p>\r\n<p>Please note: The above rules are governed by the Operator and should be used as a guide only.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Decks</strong></p>\r\n<p>● The number of decks used is 8.</p>\r\n<p>● Decks are shuffled on each new game.</p>\r\n<p>● Each deck consists of a standard 52 card deck (no Jokers).</p>\r\n<p>Please note: 3.3 Bets and PayoutsThe above rules are governed by the Gaming Engine and should be used as a guide only.</p><p><strong>Game Recovery</strong></p>\r\n<p>● In the event of a game in real play being interrupted (i.e. started but not completed due to connectivity issues or accidentally closing the browser etc), depending on the previous state of the game, it will either resume from the point at which the last cards were dealt (if the last input requirement was with the player) or display the outcome of game (if the last input requirement was with the dealer).</p>\r\n<p>● Any winnings will be correctly credited to the player account and will be exact according to the result prior to the game being interrupted.</p><p>● This game has a theoretical Return to Player of up to 99.31% based on best player strategy.</p>\r\n<p>● System malfunction voids all pays and all plays.</p>",

                "gameInfo": "<p>Wilbur&rsquo;s Wild Wonderland is a 3x5 slot with 20 winlines that features 36 Free Spins and Win Spins bonus rounds and 4 base game modifiers.</p>\r\n<p>Each press of PLAY will action each reel to spin to a random position. Wins are paid for matching some 2 of-a-kind and all 3, 4 or 5 of-a-kind symbols.</p>\r\n<p>All wins are paid left to right.</p>\r\n<p>All wins shown on different winlines will be shown and paid to the player.</p>\r\n<p>The Wild symbol can substitute for ALL other symbols, (except the Bonus symbol), to help create a line win. Using a Wild symbol to complete a line does not incur any extra multiplier other than the win for the symbol(s) it substitutes. Only the highest paying win on each line will be counted.</p>\r\n<p>3 or more Bonus trigger symbols will trigger the feature and can appear on any of the reels. There is an associated payout for 3+. Once the feature has been triggered the game will do a transition into a map of the theme park.</p>\r\n<p>The player is prompted to select any of the rides populated on the theme park map. The player picks rides until they are forced to stop selecting by way of the park being &lsquo;closed&rsquo;. On each selection, the player will be given various components which will accumulate to build a bonus round.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Set Your Stake</strong></p>\r\n<p>The player can choose their stake by pressing the + and - buttons on the left of the screen. The stake will be shown in the Total Stake meter. <br /><br /><strong>Features </strong></p>\r\n<p>Modifiers: &lsquo;Ticket to Ride&rsquo; - During the main game, on random occasions, a modifier can alter the spin event. During any spin, the player may be presented with the theme park owner, Wilbur, who will ask you to pick from a choice of 4 mystery tickets for a ride. Once you have chosen one of them, the ticket is flipped to reveal a ride logo. The tickets not chosen are also revealed to the player, deselected, and the reels come to a halt. The 4 modifiers are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>'The Ferris Wheel modifier:</strong> Once the single spin of the reels come to a halt, you will be presented with overlaid Wilds in a predetermined pattern. The Wilds will move 5 times in a pattern which will process any wins which may occur as the Wilds move as overlays over the current reel stop. The &lsquo;Ferris Wheel&rsquo; is a series of 3 Wilds stacked on the middle reel which then pivot in a clockwise direction. The Wilds move in a straight line rotating like a wheel with the middle wild on the middle reel being the axis. On the 5th rotation the Wilds return to vertical stacked Wilds on the middle reel.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'The Caterpillar modifier:</strong> Once the single spin of the reels come to a halt, you will be presented with overlaid Wilds in a predetermined pattern. The Wilds will move 5 times in a pattern which will process any wins which may occur as the Wilds move as overlays over the current reel stop. The &lsquo;Caterpillar&rsquo; is a series of 3 Wilds joined together which then move in an anti-clockwise direction around the very outer symbols on the reels presentation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'The Tea Cups modifier:</strong> Once the single spin of the reels come to a halt, you will be presented with overlaid Wilds in a predetermined pattern. The Wilds will move 5 times in a pattern which will process any wins which may occur as the Wilds move as overlays over the current reel stop. The &lsquo;Tea Cups&rsquo; is a series of 4 Wilds which move in a rotating pattern. On the 5th rotation the Wilds return to their original position.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'The Carousel modifier:</strong> Once the single spin of the reels come to a halt, you will be presented with overlaid Wilds in a predetermined pattern. The Wilds will move 5 times in a pattern which will process any wins which may occur as the Wilds move as overlays over the current reel stop. The &lsquo;Carousel&rsquo; is a series of 3 Wilds arranged in a triangular shape around the middle reel which then pivot in a clockwise direction. The Wilds move in a rotating fashion around the middle symbol on the middle reel. On the 5th rotation the Wilds return to their original layout.</p>\r\n<p>During main game play, there will be, at random, scatter bonus symbols landing in the reel frames 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Once the bonus event has been triggered you will be presented with a transition to an interactive theme park map. Scatter Bonus symbols are not present during free spins nor win spins.</p>\r\n<p>Once the map is activated, you are is prompted to select any of the rides populated on the map. You have up to 10 picks until you find a &lsquo;Park closed&rsquo; and are forced to stop selecting. Each successful selection will give you various components which will accumulate to build a bonus free spins or win spins round.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Standard Win Spins:</strong> These will be spins on the reels where the outcome is always a winning combination. There are up to 8 potential combinations of spin amounts varying from 5 to 50 Win Spins.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Win Spins without 'symbols':</strong> These will be spins on the reels where the outcome is always a winning combination with 3 or more of the lower paying symbols removed (10, J, Q, K, A, and Hotdog). These improve the wins as other higher paying symbols will replace those removed on the reels in the winning combinations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Unlimited Win Spins with 'Lives':</strong> These will be spins on the reels where the outcome is always a winning combination. The amount of spins is not restricted, however, at random, a 'Heart' symbol will land anywhere on reel 5 and stop the spins. However, if the player has lives left, the heart symbol will be ignored and a life will be taken away from the lives meter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Win Spins with 'Multipliers':</strong> These will be spins on the reels where the outcome is always a winning combination. However, during the 5 to 10 spins, each spin will have a multiplier applied which will improve the win between 2x and 5x of the winning combination.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Free Spins with 'Additional Wilds':</strong> These will be between 5 to 100 Free Spins on the reels, which may spin to a winning or a losing combination. However, during the spins, extra Wild symbols may land on the reels. The addition of extra Wilds increase the chance of a better win as more Wilds are added.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Free Spins with 'Multipliers':</strong> These are Free Spins on the reels, which may spin to a winning or a losing combination. There;are up to 5 of these spin types varying from 5 to 100 Free Spins and range from 2x to 5x multipliers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Free Spins with 'Wild Reels':</strong> These will be between 5 to 10 Free Spins on the reels, which may spin to a winning or a losing combination. However, during the spins, 1 to 4 reels can become Wild. The addition of extra Wilds increase the chance of a better win.</p>\r\n<p><strong>'Free Spins with 'Extra Winlines':</strong> These are Free Spins on the base game which may spin to a winning or a losing combination. There are up to 3 of these spin types, each with 10 Free Spins, the extra winlines varying from 5 to 20. These extra winlines can take the base game from 20 up to 40 winlines. The more winlines that are activated the greater the chance of winning combinations on the reels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Buttons </strong></p>\r\n<p>Pressing the rotating arrow icon above the play button will open a dialogue panel from which the player can access the autoplays adjuster. If autoplays are not approved in the jurisdiction, this button will not be available.</p>\r\n<p>Pressing the &lsquo;menu&rsquo; icon, on the right-hand side above the rotating arrow icon , will open the Paytable information. The player can press the arrows left and right to access all the game information. Pressing the &lsquo;X&rsquo; button will return the player to the main game interface.</p>\r\n<p>Accessing the Paytable will allow the player to toggle the sounds on/off. On a device that is compatible, the player can also turn on/off the vibrate function. On launch of the game, the default setting will be ON for both of these options.</p>\r\n<p>Plus and minus buttons on &lsquo;Total Stake&rsquo; adjust the player's total stake on each spin.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Paytable</strong></p>\r\n<p>Only the highest win per bet line is paid.</p>\r\n<p>Line wins will pay from left to right only.</p>\r\n<p>Adjustment of the stake will dynamically alter the awards in the paytable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Game Recovery </strong></p>\r\n<p>In the event of a game in real play being interrupted, (i.e. started but not completed due to connectivity issues or accidentally closing the browser, etc.), depending on the previous state of the game, it will either resume from the point of the last spin or display the outcome of the game already in play.

There are 6 modifiers and a &lsquo;Raining Wild&rsquo; Free Spins round.</span></p>\r\n<ul class=\"c13 lst-kix_c0bdp0ept9my-0 start\">\r\n<li class=\"c14 c25\"><span class=\"c1\">Set your stake: On the left of the screen, t</span><span class=\"c1\">he player can choose their stake by pressing the + and - buttons. The stake will be shown in the Total Stake meter.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"c14 c25\"><span class=\"c1\">Each press of PLAY will action each reel to spin to a random position. Wins are paid for matching&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c1\">3, 4 or 5 of-a-kind symbols</span><span class=\"c1\">&nbsp;a</span>nd also 2 of-a-kind Wild and Logo symbols on winlines.<span class=\"c50\">&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"c14 c25\"><span class=\"c7 c1\">Line wins pay left to right. All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning from the far left.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"c14 c25\"><span class=\"c7 c1\">All wins shown on different winlines will be shown and paid to the player.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"c13 lst-kix_2byqdhhuhslt-0 start\">\r\n<li class=\"c20 c25\"><span class=\"c7\">The Wild symbol and &lsquo;Raining Wilds&rsquo; symbols can substitute for ALL other symbols, EXCEPT scatter symbols, to help create a line win. Using a Wild symbol to complete a line does not incur any extra multiplier other than the win for the symbol(s) it substitutes. Only the highest paying win on each line will be counted.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"c20 c25\">There are &lsquo;Raining Wilds&rsquo;&nbsp;symbols that can appear on any of the 1 to 5 reels.&nbsp;This unique gameplay is persistent from game to game. When the player presses &lsquo;PLAY&rsquo;, the reels spin as they normally do in a traditional slot. However, occasionally, sets of overlaid &lsquo;Rain<span class=\"c7\">ing Wilds&rsquo; start to drop down from any of the 5 reel positions above the reels. Once the &lsquo;Raining Wilds&rsquo; has started, these &lsquo;Raining Wild&rsquo; symbols remain on their own reels and move one position down per spin.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"c13 lst-kix_2byqdhhuhslt-1 start\">\r\n<li class=\"c20 c28\">As they move down the aperture, the player will see these Wilds for 3 spins.&nbsp;More &lsquo;Raining Wilds&rsquo; can appear in the reels<span class=\"c7\">&nbsp;and there will be periods of play when NO &lsquo;Raining Wilds&rsquo; are present.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"c13 lst-kix_2byqdhhuhslt-0\">\r\n<li class=\"c20 c25\">Bonus Scatter Symbols: These symbols can appear on any reel. 3 or more Bonus scatter symbols landing on any of the reels will trigger the Bonus feature and award Free Spins&nbsp;as follows:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"c13 lst-kix_2byqdhhuhslt-1 start\">\r\n<li class=\"c20 c28\">3 Bonus scatter symbols in view trigger 10 Free Spins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"c8\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"c19\"><span class=\"c7\">An extra 5 Free Spins will be awarded for each additional Bonus symbol in view.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c14 c12\"><strong>&nbsp;Base Game Modifiers</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"c20\">During the base game, on any spin there will be a chance that the stormclouds gather and a lightning or wind modifier will strike&nbsp;the reels, awarding one of the following modifications:</p>\r\n<p class=\"c14 c12\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul class=\"c13 lst-kix_oth83o6t2my4-0 start\">\r\n<li class=\"c20 c25\"><span class=\"c2\">Lightning Times</span><span class=\"c67\">:</span><span class=\"c7\">&nbsp;Player presses PLAY, the reels keep spinning, the storm clouds gather and lightning strikes the reels and a multiplier is shown to the player. If there are any wins once the reels come to a halt, these are multiplied by the value that was shown.

                "gameInfo": "<p>Wolf on Win Street is a 20 Line 5X3 reel slot themed upon the stock market based in the 1980s. The game features &lsquo;Wolfie&rsquo;s Wild Stocks&rsquo; in the base game, modifiers and a unique bonus Free Spins round which allows the player to&nbsp;&lsquo;Keep&rsquo;&nbsp;or Sell&rsquo;&nbsp;any offered expanding Wild reels.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Set your stake: On the left of the screen, the player can choose their stake by pressing the + and - buttons. The stake will be shown in the Total Stake meter.</li>\r\n<li>Each press of PLAY will action each reel to spin to a random position. Wins are paid for matching 3, 4 or 5 of-a-kind symbols&nbsp;and also 2 of-a-kind Wild and Logo symbols on winlines.</li>\r\n<li>Line wins pay left to right. All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning from the far left.</li>\r\n<li>All wins shown on different winlines will be shown and paid to the player.</li>\r\n<li>The Wild symbol can substitute for ALL other symbols EXCEPT Bonus scatter symbols. Using a Wild symbol to complete a line does not incur any extra multiplier other than the win for the symbol(s) it substitutes. Only the highest paying win on each line will be counted.</li>\r\n<li>There is a &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol that can appear on any of the 1 to 5 reels. There will only be one &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol per reel. If a &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol lands in view, then it will activate whatever event or value that is above that individual reel. During Free Spins, the &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol will activate the expanding Wilds trading event. The &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol also acts as a normal &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; symbol too.</li>\r\n<li>Bonus Scatter Symbols: These symbols can appear on any reel. 3 or more Bonus scatter symbols landing on any of the reels will trigger the Wolfie&rsquo;s Free Spins feature and award Free Spins as per the table below. Two scatter symbols on reels 1 to 4 will trigger an anticipation on the next reels.</li>\r\n<li>If a player triggers the Wolfie&rsquo;s Free Spins feature, they will always win a predefined amount of Free Spins and also a &lsquo;Welcome Bonus&rsquo; prize, (multiplier of current stake), at the start of every feature:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<table style=\"width: 450px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 94px;\">\r\n<p>5 Scatters</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 95px;\">\r\n<p>4 Scatters</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 95px;\">\r\n<p>3 Scatters</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">\r\n<p>Free Spins</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 94px;\">\r\n<p>8</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 95px;\">\r\n<p>7</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 95px;\">\r\n<p>6</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">\r\n<p>Welcome Bonus</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 94px;\">\r\n<p>X10 stake</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 95px;\">\r\n<p>X7 stake</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 95px;\">\r\n<p>x5 stake</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong><br />Wolfie's Wild Stocks</strong></p>\r\n<p>Above the 5 reels in the base game will be 5 &lsquo;stock market positions&rsquo;, represented by a panel streaming text across the reels. On every spin, multiplier values, spaces, (represented as dots), or the words &lsquo;BONUS&rsquo; scroll across rapidly, like a stock market ticker. The ticker comes to rest just before the reels stop, so, at the top of each reel, there will be a random award. If the &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol appears on any reel, it will act as the trigger to receive the reward, if any, at the top of that reel.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Base Game Modifiers</strong></p>\r\n<p>Awarded&nbsp;via a telephone call to the <strong>Wolfie</strong> character:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Crazy Stocks&nbsp;-&nbsp;Player presses PLAY, reels keep spinning, the 5 values above the reels will scroll along the ticker and all will be&nbsp;&lsquo;big&rsquo; multiplier values.&nbsp;Should the &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol appear on the reels, then the corresponding value above, on that particular reel, will be multiplied by the current game stake and paid as a big win to the player. It is possible to achieve &lsquo;Wolfie Wilds&rsquo; on every reel. This does not guarantee a win.</li>\r\n<li>Market Mover - Player presses PLAY, a market position &lsquo;bar graph&rsquo; will appear&nbsp;in front of the reels, moving from right to left. As this bar graph moves, it will be populated with &lsquo;Wilds&rsquo;. Each of the bars on the chart&nbsp;will have stacked Wilds which fill the reel positions at various heights. Once this settles, the bar graph positions effectively, become Wild symbols and then the reels will land and pay the player any wins. This does not guarantee a win.</li>\r\n<li>Market Crash&nbsp;- Player presses PLAY and a line graph will appear&nbsp;in front of the reels. This will leave a trail of random Wilds on the &lsquo;peaks&rsquo; and &lsquo;troughs&rsquo;. Once this settles, the Wilds will be in place, (on the line of the graph), and the remaining base game symbols will land. This does not guarantee a win.</li>\r\n<li>Bonus Chance&nbsp;- All 5 of the panels above the reels will state &lsquo;BONUS&rsquo;, therefore, any &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol in view will trigger Wolfie&rsquo;s Free Spins feature.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Bonus Free Spins Feature</strong></p>\r\n<p>During the Wolfie&rsquo;s Wild Free Spins feature, the Free Spins will play out and execute any wins, as per a normal spin, without taking a credit. If a &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol lands, it expands to cover the whole reel, creating a &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; reel. Any wins created by the expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; will be paid to the player.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Expanding Wilds trading offer: If a &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbol lands, it covers the whole reel. The game will then make you an offer in&nbsp;the trading event to either &lsquo;KEEP&rsquo; or&nbsp;&rsquo;SELL&rsquo;&nbsp;that &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; reel and any others that the player has already got.</li>\r\n<li>If the player accepts the instant cash offer &lsquo;SELL&rsquo;,this will remove the expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; for the rest of the Free Spins and the cash will go into the Total Win field.</li>\r\n<li>If the players &lsquo;KEEPS&rsquo;the expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo;, then the cash offer is declined and the player keeps the expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; reel in place for the rest of the Free Spins.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>The player maynot get any &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbols during the Free Spins which, in turn, means there will be no offers during the Free Spins.</li>\r\n<li>It is also possible to get multiple offers via&nbsp;the &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbols landing again. Further &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbols can land at random with a possibility to get up to5 Wild reels and, therefore, 5 offers during the Free Spins feature.</li>\r\n<li>If the player chooses to accept an instant cash offer, (&lsquo;SELL&rsquo;),removing the expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; reel, the player will still get other offers if further &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbols land. This will repeat on each and every &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo;, however, the offer value made may be different, based upon the position of the expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; reel and how many Free Spins are left. The offers will be based upon probabilities and risk.</li>\r\n<li>If the player has declined the instant cash offers and &lsquo;KEEPS&lsquo;the expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; reels, the player will still get offers if further &lsquo;Wolfie Wild&rsquo; symbols land. The offer made may be different, based upon the position of the new&nbsp;expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo;&nbsp;reel, also the other expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; reels in view and how many Free Spins are left.</li>\r\n<li>Please note: If the player has declined the offer and &lsquo;KEEPS&lsquo;the expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo;&nbsp;reels but, on the next offer, chooses to accept the new offer &lsquo;SELL&lsquo;, this will remove ALL the&nbsp;current expanding &lsquo;Wild&rsquo; reels in view for the next Free Spins.</li>\r\n<li>Bonus scatter symbols are not available during Free Spins.</li>\r\n<li>All wins will be relative to the current total bet and the base game paytable.</li>\r\n<li>System malfunction voids all pays and plays.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pressing the rotating arrow icon, above the PLAY button, will open the Autoplay functionality. This functionality is not made available if Autoplay is not allowed in that particular jurisdiction.</li>\r\n<li>Pressing the &lsquo;settings&rsquo; button, on the right-hand side of the base game screen, will open the Paytable information.&nbsp;The player can press&nbsp;the left and right arrow buttons to access the in-game information.

The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same.</p>\r\n<p>The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc. For example, if the top award is won on a given play of the game, the chances of winning the top award on the next play are exactly the same. Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds.</p>\r\n<p>The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of plays by numerous players over an extended period of time. The results for any given player over a play session can vary widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, the wider the normal variance of actual payback that may be experienced.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>\r\n<p>&copy; 2018 IGT.
